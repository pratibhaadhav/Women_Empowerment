    <h2 class="h2-responsive text-center p-3">Funding Norms by Government</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="p-3" id="content">
        <p>Any financial fund granted to the NGO by the Government of India is under the category of Government funding. 
        If any NGO has to obtain Government funding, then it needs to submit about their project in the ministry of Government and let the 
        ministry know about the work which the NGO needs money. 
        If the project is approved then the NGO shall receive the fund. If it is disapproved by the Government 
        then the NGO won’t be able to get the funds.</p>

    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>The Government Ministries, Government Departments and Public sectors have certain rules, parameters, terms and regulations on the basis of certain criteria on which the NGOs are given the funds and schemes from the Government.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The major requirement is that the NGO must be registered and empanelled in the NITI Aayog.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The NGO must have the unique ID after getting empanelled in order to receive the government funding.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In general practice, after 3 years of the successful NGO registration, the NGO will be eligible for government funding. Nonetheless, in certain exceptional cases if the NGO gets permission for their project plans then the government funding can be acquired just after one year of the NGO registration.</li>
        <br>
        <li>For getting Government funding, the applicant should login NGO Darpan government website.</li>   
        <br>
        <li>The applicant shall click on “Apply for Grant” link in the darpan site and further proceed by clicking on the available links.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The applicant is required to submit his complete project proposal in accordance with the guidelines of that specific page of the concerned Department.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>
        The programme will be implemented in the sectors listed above. As the programme is to
        cover the various sectors different from each, the cost of the project is bound to vary from project to
        project. It has been, therefore, decided that the NABARD approved norms will be made applicable to
        the project to be sanctioned under STEP scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the areas/in the cases of the projects where NABARD Norms are not available the advice of the concerned
        Technical Ministry will be obtained
        before a project is sanctioned with the approval of the project Sanctioning Committee. However, it will be
        ensured that per capita cost does not exceed <b>Rs. 16,000</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        As per practice, the technical
        feasibility and item-wise cost of the project will be ascertained in consultation with the concerned
        Technical Ministry/Department before a project is sanctioned with the approval of the Project
        Sanctioning Committee.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, the services of other agencies/ institutes may be also availed of for
        pre-appraisal of the project proposals or technical advice, if required. In sanctioning projects, it will
        be ensured that the tapering Budget is prepared so that the project becomes sustainable of its own on
        the completion of the term of a project.
        Sanctions of Grant provided by Government are:
